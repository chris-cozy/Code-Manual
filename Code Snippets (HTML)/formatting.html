<!--FORMATTING-->
<!--
    Important to use the correct tags when formatting your page
    A common mistake is that HTML developers won't use the right tags to format,
    or they won't use all the tags available to them, because they don't know or
    don't feel like using them
    The purpose is also for organization, to keep your file readable
    They don't necessarily change the look/feel of your website
    They also help with search engine optimization

            Most webpages will have 3 distinct sections:
            Header - generally on every page, could be a navigation menu, maybe has branding info, etc
            Main Section - Where ll of the content will be
            Footer - maybe additional navigation links, branding, contact us, etc
            HTML has tags to define these, all sibling elements
        -->
        <header>
            <!-- If you have navigational elements in your header, can store them in the nav tag. I.E a list of different links to pages in your website-->
            <nav>

            </nav>
        </header>
        <main>
            <!--The article tag will define article text. I.E a blog post-->
            <article>
                <!--Can use this section tag to break up/separate parts of your website. Works well with the article tag-->
                <section>
                    <!--Generally want to include a header for each section-->
                    <!--
                        Want to be careful with how you are using your headers
                        Generally you only want one h1, as the main title
                        Below the h1, h2s. If you want another header inside that h2 section, use h3, etc.
                        Best practice to use a heirarchy fashion
