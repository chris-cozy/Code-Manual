Pay attention to the project location when creating a new project

Creating a new package
    New package, lowercase letter first
        - Example cpsc2150.helloworld
        - The cpsc2150 is the new directory
    Inside the package create a new class

Building(compiling) and running the class
    Edit configurations -> Application
        - Select main class
        - No program arguments
    Then I can run the program
    Can add other class files if needed

Creating From Template
    Base package - choose existing package to base off of
    Bad practice to have a class called main
    When moving to Unix, use the .java files not the .class files, since it's compiles for the machine

Debugging
    Once there's an error, go through all of the code that I wrote and place breakpoints, then instead of clicking run click the bug to debug
    Find the line where the error is and debug
    Step into- goes into the next line of code
