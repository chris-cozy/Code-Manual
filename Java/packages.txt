A package is a grouping of classes, like a catalog or library
Hierarchy: sub packages within packages
Some standard libraries organized into packages

A package provides
	- Logical structuring: related classes are bundled
	- Encapsulation: another level of access control
	- Distinct namespace: classes in different packages can have the same name without conflict

Declaration
    Use package statement at top of source file
        - Must appear first, before any class declarations
        -  Example: package edu.clemson.cs.cpsc2150;
            ○ class Pencil {….}
    This file must be in a directory matching package name
    At most one package declaration in a file
    If there is no declaration, class is in unnamed default package
        - This is fine for very small programs

Access Control
    Another level of visibility: package
        - Default for members if visibility not specified
        - Package visible members are accessible by all classes in the same package
    Classes are either public or package (default)
        - Public classes available outside the package
        - Package classes available only within the same package
	
Type Imports
    Fully qualified type name is package.<class>
        - Don’t confuse the "." with member access
    Shorthand: import statement at top of file (for public types not package types)
        - import java.util.Date;
        - To import all public types, use wildcard *
            ○ import java.util.*;
            ○ .* does not import sub packages
    All classes implicitly import java.lang.*
    Static members can be explicitly imported and can use wildcard as well
        - import static java.lang.Math.exp;
        - exp(x); //instead of Math.exp(x)

Good Practice: Naming Conventions
    Avoid name conflicts with packages and reserved keywords
    Package names: lowercase letters, can use uppercase first letter for second word
    Class names: start with uppercase letter
    Variable, field and method names: start with lowercase letters
    Constant names: all uppercase letters

By using these conventions we can tell a lot of information
