Java can run on any machine, making it a strong, versatile language
When running a Java program you are running the JVM (Java Virtual Machine)

Creating a Java Program on Unix
	- Create a file just like with C++ on unix, but use the .java file extension
		○ Ex: HelloWorld.java
	- To compile, use javac command
		○ javac HelloWorld.java
		○ There are many flags and options for the compilers
	- To run the program, use the java command
		○ java HelloWorld
There is no file extension

Packages
    Import statements:
        Import java.util.*
        Import java.io
    
Everything in Java is a part of a class
    This is an important difference from its sister language C++
        No semi-colon at the end of classes either
    The program itself will be a class, with a public static method called making
        It is common to name this class after the program itself, or to concatenate "App" at the end of the name,
        to signify that this class contains the main function

Main function   
    public static void main(string[] args){
        //Enter code here
    }
    Can use args.length to get the number of arguments

Output
    Use System.out object, and either the print() or println() method
        System.out.println("Hello World");
    You can use the + operator to concatenate strings
        String is a defined class so it overloads the operator
        As long as one operand is a string, then it will convert the other to a string as well (if applicable)

Input
    Packages needed:
        java.io* (Newer java versions don't need this)
        java.util.*
    Create a scanner object and pass System.in to the constructor
        Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
    Now you can use the nextline() scanner method to read in a line of input
        Returns a string
    Can cause errors to have many Scanner objects reading from the same input stream.
        Programmers often have one class that interacts with the keyboard
        For smaller/simpler programs it is generally beneficial to keep it all in the class that contains the 'main' function
