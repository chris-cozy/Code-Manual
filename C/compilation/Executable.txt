To make a program executable on click:

If using Linux with the gcc/g++ command line compile tool,
compile the program with:
    g++ your_program.cpp -o your_program

you can add execute permissions to the file with the command:
    sudo chmod a+x your_program

If using windows, and developing under an IDE,
    find the build executable under the project folder, and it should be able to execute by click
