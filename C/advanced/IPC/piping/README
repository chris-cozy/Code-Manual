This concept of named piping uses temporary files to send
and recieve data between two programs.
The temp files are predefined and are closed by each program after use.

General piping info
	- Restricted to the same machine
	- Generally one directional communication
	- Easiest way to create:    ls -al | grep context
	- There are also named pipes
	- Functions like a baton pass, the sender will not finish until the receiver takes the data

PROS:
Faster than files
Built into the OS
Don't need to go to disk or the network stack, so should be faster than sockets
You can name pipes for easier accessibility
