Javascript Object Notation

    It is a data representation format, like XLM or YAML
    Commonly used for APIs and Config files
    Extremely lightweight due to small file size
    Easy to read and write
    Easily integrateable with javascrip0t, since it is a subset of Javascript
    Almost every programming language has built in functions to interpret JSON data

SYNTAX
Supports
    Strings
    Numbers
    Booleans
    null
    Arrays
    Objects - most complex but most used type in JSON

USING JSON
*file name*.json
Take one of the supported types and put it in the file.
Most of the time when working with JSON you will have an array or object as the top level of your file.
Then inside that array or object may have other values, maybe nested arrays and objects.
    example.json
When writing key value pairs in an object:
    {
        "key":"value",
        "key":"value"
    }
The strong point of JSON is the ability of nestign objects withing objects.
This differentiates it from flat data storage methods.
