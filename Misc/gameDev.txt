--GENERAL--
Have an object-oriented design


--MAIN MENU--
When making a main menu for your game, you have to consider game state.
Keeping track of what state your game is in makes this process streamlined.
    Main menu, In-game, Pause-menu, Game-over, etc.
    Can use a finite state machine

The main game loop uses _update and _draw functions.
What you can do is create your own implementation of these functions for each state
    update_menu     draw_menu
    update_game     draw_game
Set the main _update and _draw functions to the specific state functions when that state is in use

--CODING YOUR OWN PHYSICS--
Have variables for gravity and friction
    Both <1
Give each moving object variables for:
    Position x,y
    Velocity x,y (how much we add to the position per second)
    Max Velocity
    Acceleration
    Boost (Jump)

Add gravity to the y velocity
Multiply friction to the x velocity

To move the player horizontally, add or subtract acceleration to the x velocity 
To move the player vertically, add boost to the y velocity

Add the x and y velocities to the x and y position
