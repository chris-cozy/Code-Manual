BASICS
    - In jupyter notebooks, run a cell by SHIFT+ENTER
    - If you accidentally make a mistake and name a variable by a keyword, 
    resulting in an error, you can use Kernel>Restart to reset all of the variables

    In Jupyter notebooks only, you can directly write .txt files using:
        - %%writefile filename.txt
        - Contents of file etc etc

    To see where the current jupyter notebook is in the directory, run pwd in a cell
