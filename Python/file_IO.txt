I/O WITH BASIC FILES

    To open a text file in the current directory
        - myfile = open('filename.txt')
    To open a txt file in any location on your computer, still use open but provide the full file path
        - myfile = open("C: \\Users\\UserName\\Folder\\test.txt")

    .read() - reads through the file, displays \n wherever there is a new line. 
        If you call it again it will return an empty string, because the 'cursor' is already at the end of the file. 
        To reset the 'cursor', use .seek(0)
    .readlines() - separates each line into separate lines(objects)

    Don't forget to close files once you're through with them using .close()
    You will get errors if you don't do this.
    If you use a with/as statement you don't have to worry about closing the file and you can still grab its contents.
        with open('myfile.txt') as my_new_file:
        contents = my_new_file.read()

    By using Shift+Tab right after open and before the file name you can access the File's information, such as the mode, which can be equal to:
        'r' (read)
        'w' (write or create new files)
        'a' (append)
        'r+' (read and write)
        'w+" (write and read or create new files)

        with open('newfile.txt', mode = 'a') as f:
            f.write('Four on fourth')
        or
        newfile = open('test.txt','w')
        newfile.write('Hello World')
        newfile.close()
