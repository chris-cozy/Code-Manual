No framework is objectively better than all the others, different use cases will require different frameworks.
- Exampe: If you want to begin GUIs by designing a graphical game, PyGame would be a good framework.
- Example: If you want to build web apps, you may want to avoid Python GUI and use it for backend work using Flask or Django instead. With webapps, HTML CSS, and Javascript are better options for web app GUIs

## This Example
Widgets in Jupyter Notebook setting. This type of GUI is good for creating dashboards for data/business analysis situations.
You won't be able to see the sliders on Github, because Github is simply hosting the code, not running it.
### Necessary Libraries
ipywidgets
- They have switched over to a Bootstrap style, for coloring and styling the widgets
