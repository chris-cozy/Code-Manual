Inside phpmyadmin you can go to the SQL tab and write SQL code in your database that will create the tables. Example below

            the not null means this cannot be empty.
            the primary key means that this is unique and no other row can have the same value as it
            the auto increment means that when there is a new post this value will auto increment by 1 to make it unique
            datetime does not need a type
            Good to save your table code somewhere in case a mistake is make and the table has to be recreated at some point

            create table posts (
                id int(11) not null PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
                subject varchar(11) not null,
                content varchar(1000) not null,
                date datetime not null
            );


            ---Inserting data into the database tables---
            Will be the code that will be in php
            Inside the first parenthesis you put the name of the column, inside values go the values.
            If you have an auto increment variable you do not need to include it
            Can also save this in a separate document

            insert into posts (subject, content, date) VALUES ('This is the subject', 'This is the content, etc', '2015-11-14 16:38:01');

            ---Selecting from the database--- this sql code will be the same as in php

            select subject from posts
            select * from posts //The star signifies all fields/columns. Can be useful for checking if the username and passowrd exists in the same entry (is a proper login)
            select all from posts where id='1' //Selects everything from posts where id = 1. Will be useful for pulling media info
            select all from posts where id='1' AND subject='This is the subject' //Can also use 'AND' and 'OR'

            ---Updating data from the database---
            Same code that will be in php
            Will be useful for updating profile, media titles, etc

            update posts //Can use either a space or press enter after this
            set subject='This is a test', content='This is the content'
            where id='1'
            
            ---Deleting data from tables---
            Same code that will be in php

            delete from posts //Can use either space or enter
            where id='1' //If you don't include the where it where delete all data in the table

            ---Ordering data in database---
            Where by number large to small, or by date, etc

            SELECT * FROM posts ORDER BY id ASC //ASC is for ascending 1->10, DESC is for descending 10->
            SELECT * FROM posts ORDER BY subject ASC //Because these aren't ints it will order alphabetically
