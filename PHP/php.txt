Prerequisites to learn php:
Knowing HTML and CSS

Allows you to make websites more dynamic, and connect with databases
PHP is a server-side language
Can be confusing to learn in the beginning
When you have a .php document, you can write HTML, CSS, JS, etc inside your php document
This is why many developers stop using HTML documents after learning php

Installing a local server on your computer (necessary to run php):
XAMPP
    - TO get the server runnning, find xampp control exe in the xampp directory, and start Apache and MySQL
    - Then in your browser you can go to localhost/phpmyadmin

Because we are using the Clemson Servers for the project, this is extra^
You don't need to do anything with phpmyadmin to make php work, you just need the Apache and PHP servers runnning

Within the xampp2 directory, you want to navigate to the htdocs directory, and make a subdirectory as the root for your current project.
This is where you will store all of your php code

Just like index.html, if you name a file index.php it will be recognized as the starting page
