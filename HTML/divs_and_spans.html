            Difference between a div and a span
            The two basic ways HTML displays elements: block and inline
            Block elements: take up the entire page width
            Inline elements: Only take up the space that they need, can put these nexts to each other
            Some tags are block tags like paragraphs, some are inline tags like links
            
            Spans are inline containers, Divs are block containers
