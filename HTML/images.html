        <!-- 
            Image tag (single): include the location of the desired image
            A basic way to do this is put the address for an image on the internet
            Can also use images in the current directory
            The alt attribute is what will show up if the image cannot be found
        
            The pictures are naturally large, they can be resized with attributes width and height, and pixel count
            You want to be sure to keep the same aspect ratio of the original image to avoid distortion
            To avoid having to calculate this, you can change only the width or height and HTML will adjust the othe to keep the aspect ratio for you
