    <h1>Hello World</h1>
    <!-- Need a script element to host javascript code. This can 
    be placed in either the head or the body. Best practice: Put it at the very end of the body section
    This is because web files are parsed from top to bottom, so if your script is first
    your page will be white/blank until the script is done being analyzed
    There are exceptions to this rule-->
    <script src= 'index.js'>
        //We include the source js file to grab the code from
        //While we could write js code here, for separation of concerns, we separate javascript code and html code into different files
        //HTML is all about content, while Javascript is all about behavior
        //In real world application, we may have hundreds of js files, bundled and served to th client
