PRIVATES, GETTERS/SETTERS, 

When using private fields, you can't access them from other classes like with public fields
Must use getters and setters to access and change the variables.
This makes them more secure/protected.
By making the getters/setters public, we can call them from outside the class
     
PROPERTIES
An easy way to implement the process of getting and setting private field values
They use what are called accessors, which have the same logic as the getter and setter methods.
Can use a capital for the property and a lowercase for the field to distinguish between the two.
I.E: 
     private int age
     public int Age{
         get {return age;}
         set {age = value;}
     }
Once created, to use in another class:
     myCat.Age
     By default it will call the get accessor

     myCat.Age = 7
     This will call the set accessor, and set the age
